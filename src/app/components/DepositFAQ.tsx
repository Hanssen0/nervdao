      question: "When can I withdraw my deposit?",
      answer: "You can initiate a withdrawal from Nervos DAO at any time. However, withdrawals will only complete after the current 30-day cycle (or roughly 180 epochs) has finished. Once the cycle ends, your CKB will be available for use, and you'll receive your initial deposit along with any earned compensation."
    },
    {
      question: "How are compensation calculated for my deposit?",
      answer: "Compensation is calculated based on the amount deposited and the duration of the deposit. The longer you keep your CKB in the Nervos DAO, the more compensation you'll earn."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of depositing CKB into the Nervos DAO?",
      answer: "Depositing CKB into the Nervos DAO allows you to earn compensation and participate in the network's governance. It also helps to secure the network and maintain the value of CKB."
