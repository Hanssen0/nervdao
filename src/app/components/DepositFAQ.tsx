        "You can initiate a redemption from Nervos DAO at any time. However, redemptions will only settle when reaching checkpoints. Checkpoints happen every 180-epoch cycle (roughly 30 days) after depositing, so we recommend redeeming near the end of cycles for maximum profit. Once the settlement period ends, you can withdraw your CKB at any time, and you'll receive your initial deposit and all earned compensation.",

        "Compensation is calculated based on the amount deposited and the duration of the deposit. The longer you keep your CKB in the Nervos DAO, the more compensation you'll earn.",
